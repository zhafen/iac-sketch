enables_iterative_system_decomposition:
- description: >
    The requirements and components of complicated systems are rarely known all at
    once, but are assembled over time in an iterative process. This process includes
    gathering functional requirements from the stakeholders, identifying technical
    requirements/constraints, trial and error, and more. One of the goals of
    iac_sketch is to provide a constant, living source of truth that can be used for
    both the formalized design and also components and requirements not yet
    incorporated.

perform_registry_etl:
- description: >
    How entities are defined and parsed.
    When entities are defined, their definitions depend on existing entities.
    We want to create all entities in order, such that their dependencies
    are resolved first. This is the mathematical problem of topological
    sorting, and networkx can solve this problem.
