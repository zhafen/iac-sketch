- component
- fields:
    value [str]: >

        with linebreaks separating different links.
    link_type [entity]:
        description: >
            The type of the links. Must be a component that has either a source and target
            component or a link component.
        default: depended_on_by

link_type:
- description: >
    If a [compdef] entity owns a [link_type] component then the component represents

- component:
    multiplicity: "0..1"
- fields:

- link_type:
    reverse: child
- fields:
    value [entity]: The parent entity to the owner entity.

depends_on:
- description: The source entity depends on the target entity.
- component
- link_type:
    reverse: depended_on_by
- fields:
    value [entity]: The entity the owner entity depends on.
