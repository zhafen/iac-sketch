report:
- description: >
    A report is a set of code, tables, etc. generated in response to a request.
    Possible names:
    - report
    - product
    - delivery
    - deliverable
    - report
    - solution
    - collection
    We are already using report widely, though. E.g. ra_reports, research_dm.reports.
- data:
    report_id [str]: ID for the report, {irb_number}.{irb_rank:.02d} (e.g. STU001234.01)
    irb_number [str]: IRB number for the study associated with the report.
    irb_rank [int]: >
        IRB rank is defined as the number of reports associated with a study at
        the time of request intake, counting the report itself. As such, IRB rank
        starts at 1 and increases in steps of 1. When doing a partition over irb_number
        ordered by created_date ascending this is the row number.
    azdo_id [int]: Azure DevOps ticket associated with the request.
    pbi_workspace [str]: Which Power BI workspace the report lives in.
    inserted_datetime [timestamp]: >
        Date when the report was created, i.e. the product_id was created and we started
        tracking report status.

request:
- description: The data submitted via the intake form.
- data:
    snow_id [str]: The service now ticket associated with the request.
    product_id [str]: The ID of the overall product.
    requester_net_id [str]: NU Net ID for the requester.
    irb_number [str]: IRB number of the associated study.
    description [str]: Description of the request.
- primary_key: snow_id
