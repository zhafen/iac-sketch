cross_institution_data_delivery:
- description: >
    A data delivery from NU to another university. Such exchanges require a data use
    agreement (DUA).

    It is encouraged not to send data directly to the external party from NMEDW.
    Instead this responsibility should lie with the stakeholder.
    It is also encouraged for data to be de-identified.

variable_naming_conventions:
- description: >
    Snake case. Do not put the type in the name unless there's possible confusion.
    Including a reference to the variable type in the name is optional;
    if included the reference should be appended to the end of the name separated
    by an underscore.
    Variables should be referred to by their full name unless there is an instantly
    recognizable letter that can be substituted. For example, time_observed can be
    t_observed.
    Variables that represent a boolean or list-like of booleans should start with "is",
    "are", or "has".

forgotten_ticket_incident:

    Tickets ignored/de-prioritized for a while. One ticket got ignored for 9 months.
    One of our analysts was assigned and it was de-prioritized.

    Possible partial solution:
    Prioritize assigning analysts to groups and domains they've worked on before.

discrepant_data_incident:

        Lots of stakeholders claim there's missing data or too much data.

brownbag:
- description: |
    1. Every week we hold a "journal club". One team member will bring an article or other item to discuss. They will send the article out ahead of time and then lead any discussion of it during brownbag.
        i. No slides are allowed, to prevent people from spending too much time preparing.
        ii. By default, the discussion is expected to take ~10-15 minutes. If it's shorter or longer that works fine too.
        iii. The article or other item should be loosely related to our work but does not need to be an exact match. For example, an article about a relevant technology, with no mention of healthcare or research, is perfectly fine.
        iv. We will choose the team members pseudo-randomly. We will shuffle the pool of team members and paste the results in the brownbag loop. People who have presented frequently (Clayton, Steven, Quan, Parmeen, managers) will be removed from the pool of possible presenters at least for a while.
    2. The time not used up by journal club will default to office hours. Some combination of Phil, Dan, Pras, or Zach will stick around for the remainder of the hour, and people can ask questions or leave as they prefer/need.
    3. Brownbags dedicated to a particular topic or two can still be scheduled and take precedence over the journal club. They're just not the default.
