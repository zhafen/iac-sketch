This directory contains metadata that is modified by hand.
Such metadata may determine key elements of our infrastructure.
No sensitive data is allowed to be stored here, e.g. in the research accounts sheet.

This directory should be a frozen copy of [the live version located here](https://nmhealth.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/EDWResearchAnalytics/EvMCuTIn0KVHuKW5r7sF2lwBv17FI10pGvKV18GkceFXIQ?e=pTx4PE).
There is currently no automatic syncing; this directory should be updated manually on a regular basis.
(Or someone should take the time to either implement automated syncing or source the data directly from the sharepoint directory.)
