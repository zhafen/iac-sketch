create_pa_account:
- description: >
    All NM Azure users need PA accounts. The URL for one-off requests is attached.

    This is a request for a PA account for an FSM Power User. FSM Power Users are
    selected researchers who work with Research Analytics and Data Stewards to export
    data from the Northwestern Medicine Enterprise Data Warehouse for use in approved
    studies. As part of the EDW cloud migration all users who need to continue
    accessing the EDW need to do so using the Azure portal and a PA account,
    which is the reason for this request.

export_pbi_to_excel:
- description: >
    Exporting a PBI dashboard to excel is something our users often want to do.
    There is a built-in functionality "Analyze in Excel", but it doesn't seem to work
    for B2B. Instead, the steps are as suggested below. This is something that
    the "Domain and Email Services" NM team helped us out with, and was first tested
    with the FSM Finance team.

- procedure:
    - Go into Excel.
    - Click on "Data" in the Ribbon.
