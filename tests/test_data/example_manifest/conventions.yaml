variable_names:
- description: >
    Snake case. Do not put the type in the name unless there's possible confusion.
    Including a reference to the variable type in the name is optional;
    if included the reference should be appended to the end of the name separated
    by an underscore.
    Variables should be referred to by their full name unless there is an instantly
    recognizable letter that can be substituted. For example, time_observed can be
    t_observed.
    Variables that represent a boolean or list-like of booleans should start with "is",
    "are", or "has".
